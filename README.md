# Welcome to the knowledge base of Duraclim's IT department !

This is our central hub of knowledge—your one-stop resource for documentation, guidelines, references, and best practices.

Whether you’re a new team member or just need a refresher, everything you need to know about how we work and what we do is right here.

You’ll find all the main chapters and subsections conveniently listed in the sidebar (on the right).

These are organized by topic—such as communication guidelines, naming conventions, design standards, project documentation, and more.

This is a living resource. If you see something that could be improved or updated, don’t hesitate to add your insights.

The more we contribute, the more valuable our knowledge base becomes.

If you have any questions, need help finding something, or have suggestions for improving our knowledge base, please reach out on Slack via #it-discussions or open an issue in the knowledge-base repository.

Remember, everyone’s input helps keep our documentation current and useful for the entire team.
